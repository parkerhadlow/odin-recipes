# odin-recipes
This simple recipe book includes three recipes: pizza, grilled cheese, and scrambled eggs. The project demonstrates my proficency with basic HTML structure, using different headings, links, images, and both ordered and unordered lists. 
The page is a work-in-progress that will be revisited shortly once I learn the basics of CSS.
